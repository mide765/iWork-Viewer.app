# iWork-Viewer.app



Scope of app
There is no way to view iWork files (Pages, Numbers, Keynote) on Linux and I would like to help with that.

This project is a hobby of mine to start learning VIM and to try to learn some terminal commands while I'm at it. 
Today is the first day I'm using VIM and this whole project will be worked in VIM.

Created a demo .numbers file and I knew you can unzip it, so that's what I did. Currently reading about .iwa file format from (https://github.com/obriensp/iWorkFileFormat/blob/master/Docs/index.md).
